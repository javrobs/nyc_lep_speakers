# Developers' Drafts
This directory contains the drafts the developers did to have the final product as it is in the API directory. 
### .ipynb_checkpoints:
This directory contains diferent jupyter notebooks in which the developers tested different methods before adding it to the final
code.
### map_draft: 
This directory contains a code that doesn't work for the choropleth maps. These were our first drafts and did not work, so we had to discard it. We decided to keep the directory 
### map_choropleth:
This directory contains what we thought would be another draft that wouldn't work for the choropleth maps, but for our own surprise it actually worked. This directory contains a "rough draft" of the choropleth map. This was then "prettified" but the code runs correctly.

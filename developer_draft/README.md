# Developers' Drafts
This directory contains the drafts the developers did to have the final product as it is in the API directory. 
### .ipynb_checkpoints:
This directory contains diferent jupyter notebooks in which the developers tested different methods before adding it to the final
code.
### map_draft: 
This directory contains a code that doesn't work for the choropleth maps. These were our first drafts and did not work, so we had to discard it. We decided to keep the directory in case that we needed some of the information in further problems 
within this project, or if we had another project and wanted to look back. 
### map_choropleth:
This directory contains what we thought would be another draft that wouldn't work for the choropleth maps, but for our own surprise it actually worked. This directory contains a "rough draft" of the choropleth map. This was then "prettified" but the code runs correctly.
###  demographic_api_test
This directory holds a jupyter notebook with different tests we did to extract transform and load the information we needed for the demographic box and the bar graph. We tried different methods until we got it right.

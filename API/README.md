# API directory
This directory was named api because we started out having only the flask app.py inside. We presented some issues running from one server to another so we ended up moving the whole project to this directory.
So, we could say that this directory is the 
### final version of the project.
We decided not to change the name of the directory to avoid having it breaking because of the directory paths. 

## Inside directory:

### images directory:
